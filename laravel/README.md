# Laravel Naive Docker Setup

## Setting up local domain

> skip this part if gonna test directly on remote droplets

http://api.garmoth.local:3050 or localhost:3050

you can change port in `docker-compose.yaml` find the nginx service

```yaml
ports:
- 3050:80 # change 3050 to your preferred port
```

head to your system's equivalent of unix `/etc/hosts`... if you don't have done it already, add entry:

```text
# garmoth
127.0.0.1 garmoth.local api.garmoth.local
```

## Starting containers

In onder for Prometheus and this Laravel app to communicate, a shared external docker network is needed:

```bash
$ docker network create promoth
# if u see a hex hash (network id), it was created just fine 
```

At the laravel project root directory, run `docker-compose up -d` to start containers, if no problem arises should output something similar to:

```text
Creating network "laravel_net" with the default driver
Creating laravel_mysql_1 ... done
Creating laravel_redis_1 ... done
Creating laravel_php_1   ... done
Creating laravel_nginx_1 ... done
```

Open up laravel app https://api.garmoth.local:3050 or with the port you have assigned... 

### Config .env

Just copy and paste .env.example into .env, after composer install maybe the `APP_KEY=` will be generated if not, use usual laravel command to generate key AFTER composer install

## php compose install

Now you will want to install the php dependencies, get inside the container as

```bash
$ docker ps

# you will see something like this:
# ......
bdef09482252   laravel_php    "docker-php-entrypoiâ€¦"   4 hours ago   Up 55 minutes   9000/tcp   laravel_php_1
# ......
# copy your "php" container name and "ssh" into it

$ docker exec -it laravel_php_1 sh
/usr/share/nginx/html #

# and run composer install
$ composer install
Loading composer repositories with package information
Installing dependencies (including require-dev) from lock file
......
```

Here the application should be running and ready, try to access it by using the url either local or remote

The path `/wait` which is under the prometheus middleware does put the page to sleep for some milliseconds for testing purposes.

Accessing this endpoint multiple times will generate enough data for prometheus to pickup and grafana display meaningful results, if you create and execute a script to access this page 2-5 times per second you will see more *better* relevant data

## Moving to production

Requirements 

- PHP's [Redis Extension](https://github.com/phpredis/phpredis) | installed with pecl is ez
- composer package: [promphp/prometheus_client_php](https://github.com/promphp/prometheus_client_php)
- Redis server running alongside the laravel app (low memory usage tbf)

Files that you want to copy/paste and perhaps modify:

- [ServiceProvider](app/Providers/PrometheusServiceProvider.php) add entry to config/app.php
- [Middleware](app/Http/Middleware/PrometheusMiddleware.php) - add entry to app/Http/Kernel.php
- [Controller](app/Http/Controllers/PrometheusController.php) add file to app/Http/Controllers
